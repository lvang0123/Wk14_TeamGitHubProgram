#Wk14_TeamGitHubProgram - Average Test Score
#This program will prompt the user for the total number of tests they have taken, their test scores for each tests, and then calculate the average of the test scores. The average of the test scores will then be outputted along with the appropriate letter grade.
#Ben, Dan, Kyle, Lisa, and Lia all worked on this program together during class.
